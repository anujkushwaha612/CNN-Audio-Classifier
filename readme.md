# üîä Deep Audio Classification CNN (PyTorch & Next.js)

This project is a full-stack, end-to-end solution for **Deep Audio Classification**. It involves building and training a complex Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch in PyTorch to classify diverse environmental sounds from raw audio waveforms, followed by deploying the model via a serverless API and creating an interactive dashboard for real-time visualization and inference.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Technical Stack

### Core Model & Training
* **Deep Audio CNN** engineered from scratch in **PyTorch**.
* **ResNet-style architecture** with residual blocks for high-precision classification.
* **Mel Spectrograms** utilized for audio-to-image conversion to feed the CNN.
* Advanced **Data Augmentation** techniques: Mixup & Time/Frequency Masking.
* Optimized training pipeline using **AdamW** and **OneCycleLR** scheduler.
* **TensorBoard** integration for detailed training analysis and monitoring.

### Deployment & Backend API
* Serverless **GPU inference** deployed via **Modal**.
* High-performance **FastAPI** endpoint for inference requests.
* **Pydantic** data validation for robust and secure API requests.

### Frontend Dashboard & Visualization
* Interactive dashboard built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS** (T3 Stack).
* **Real-time** audio classification with confidence score display.
* **Dynamic Visualization** of internal CNN feature maps (to see what the model "sees").
* Waveform and Spectrogram visualization for input analysis.
